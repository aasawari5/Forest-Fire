# Introduction
Forest fires pose a significant threat to natural ecosystems and human settlements. Early detection of these fires is crucial for timely intervention and mitigation. This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to detect forest fires from images captured by various sources.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of forests, where some images contain instances of fire while others do not. The dataset is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimshamta/forest-fire-dataset-for-classification-algorithm. 

# Approach
We employ three main algorithms for detecting forest fires:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are a type of deep neural network particularly effective for image classification tasks.
2. Logistic Regression: A classic algorithm used for binary classification tasks, logistic regression provides a baseline for comparison.
3. Random Forests: Random Forests are an ensemble learning method based on decision trees, offering robustness and accuracy.

# Usage

# Results
1. CNN: 0.98
2. Logistic Regression: 0.85
3. Random Forests: 0.81
